# Story 10.8: UAT Bug Fixes

**Status:** backlog  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Estimate:** 8h (buffer)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 10  
**Type:** Bug Fix Buffer  
**Dependencies:** Story 10.7 (UAT Execution)

---

## Story

As a **developer**,  
I want **all P0/P1 bugs discovered during UAT fixed before v1.0.0**,  
So that **the release is production-ready with no critical defects**.

## Background

This story is a buffer allocation for bugs discovered during full UAT (Story 10.7). Sprint 7 UAT found 0 P0/P1 bugs (thanks to pre-UAT reviews), but a full 10-Epic UAT may uncover issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] All P0 bugs fixed (UAT blocker)
2. [ ] All P1 bugs fixed or have documented workaround
3. [ ] P2 bugs logged as tech debt for future sprints
4. [ ] Regression tests added for each fixed bug
5. [ ] Re-run affected UAT test cases → all pass
6. [ ] All 1087+ tests still pass

## Tasks / Subtasks

_Tasks will be populated after Story 10.7 UAT execution._

- [ ] **Task 1: Bug Triage** (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [ ] Classify discovered bugs by severity (P0/P1/P2)
  - [ ] Assign fix priority

- [ ] **Task 2: Fix P0 Bugs** (AC: #1)
  - [ ] _To be determined_

- [ ] **Task 3: Fix P1 Bugs** (AC: #2)
  - [ ] _To be determined_

- [ ] **Task 4: Add Regression Tests** (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Write test for each fixed bug

- [ ] **Task 5: Re-run UAT** (AC: #5, #6)
  - [ ] Re-execute failed UAT test cases
  - [ ] Verify full test suite

## Dev Notes

### Historical Context
- Sprint 7 UAT: 15/15 passed, 0 bugs — Pre-UAT reviews were key
- Sprint 8 Code Review: 30 issues found and fixed (100%)
- If Sprint 10 discovers significant bugs, consider deferring v1.0.0

### Buffer Allocation
- 8h allocated as buffer
- If unused, time returns to Sprint capacity
- If exceeded, escalate to PO for scope decision
