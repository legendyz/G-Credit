# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Sprint 11 uses a flat structure (no epics) for Post-MVP hardening work.
# Stories are grouped by theme but not nested under epics.
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story defined in sprint backlog
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed and SM accepted
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - SM creates story docs via [CS] workflow before development begins
# - Dev moves story to 'in-progress', then to 'review'
# - SM acceptance moves story to 'done'
# - Stories within the same Wave can be parallelized if no dependencies
