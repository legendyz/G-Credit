## 🚨 Critical Path Check

### **Can Sprint 7 Start Without These Tasks?**

| Task | Blocks Day 1? | Blocks Day 2? | Blocks Day 3? | Can Defer? |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Action #11 (Login wireframe)** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ **YES** | No |
| **Action #12 (Story 9.1 tech spec)** | ✅ **YES** | ❌ No | ❌ No | No |
| **Action #13 (axe-core setup)** | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No | ❌ No | Yes (15min) |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Day 1 can start** if Action #12 is completed (or Story 9.1 has sufficient detail)
- ✅ **Action #13 can be done Day 1 morning** (only 30 minutes)
- ⚠️ **Action #11 must be done before Day 3** (Story 0.2a starts Day 3)
