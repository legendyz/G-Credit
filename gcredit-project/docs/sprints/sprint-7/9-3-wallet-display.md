# Story 9.3: Employee Wallet Display for Revoked Badges

**Story ID:** Story 9.3  
**Epic:** Epic 9 - Badge Revocation  
**Sprint:** Sprint 7  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Status:** Backlog

---

## User Story

**As an** Employee,  
**I want** to see which of my badges have been revoked in my wallet,  
**So that** I am informed of status changes and can understand why.

---

## Background / Context

Currently, Employee Wallet (`/wallet`) displays all issued badges without status distinction. When badges are revoked (Story 9.1), employees must:
1. See revoked badges marked clearly (not silently disappear)
2. Understand why revocation happened
3. Distinguish active vs. revoked credentials

Hiding revoked badges without notice would confuse employees. Showing them with clear status maintains transparency and trust.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Visual Status Badge
**Given** I am logged in as Employee with revoked badges  
**When** I view My Wallet page  
**Then** revoked badges display with red "REVOKED" badge overlay

- [x] Red status badge/pill on badge card
- [x] "REVOKED" text or icon (🚫)
- [x] Badge card visually distinct (grayed out, reduced opacity, or red border)
- [x] Active badges remain unchanged

### AC2: Revocation Details in Modal/Drawer
**Given** I click on a revoked badge in wallet  
**When** details modal/drawer opens  
**Then** I see revocation information prominently

- [x] Revoked date (e.g., "Revoked on February 5, 2026")
- [x] Revocation reason (Policy Violation, Issued in Error, Expired, Other)
- [x] Optional notes explaining why
- [x] Original issuance details still visible

### AC3: Download and Share Disabled
- [x] Download button disabled or hidden for revoked badges
- [x] Share button (LinkedIn, Teams) disabled
- [x] Tooltip explains: "This badge has been revoked and cannot be shared"

### AC4: Filtering and Sorting
- [x] Badge wallet supports status filter: "All" | "Active" | "Revoked"
- [x] Default view: "Active" (hides revoked badges unless explicitly selected)
- [x] Filter persists in session storage

### AC5: API Integration
- [x] Call `GET /api/badges/my-badges` includes `status` field
- [x] Frontend filters badges by status client-side
- [x] Response format:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "templateName": "...",
      "status": "ISSUED" | "CLAIMED" | "REVOKED",
      "revokedAt": "2026-02-05T14:30:00Z" (if revoked),
      "revocationReason": "..." (if revoked)
    }
  ]
  ```

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [x] Wallet page load time < 1.5 seconds (no regression)
- [x] Filtering animation smooth (no jank)

### Accessibility
- [x] ARIA label for revoked status: `aria-label="Badge revoked on [date]"`
- [x] Keyboard navigation works (tab through filter buttons)
- [x] Screen reader announces badge status

### UX
- [x] Not overwhelming (default hides revoked badges)
- [x] Clear path to see revoked badges (filter toggle)
- [x] Empathetic messaging (not accusatory tone)

    include: {
      template: {
        select: { name: true, imageUrl: true }
      }
    },
    orderBy: { issuedAt: 'desc' }
  });

  return badges.map(badge => ({
    id: badge.id,
    templateName: badge.template.name,
    templateImageUrl: badge.template.imageUrl,
    issuedAt: badge.issuedAt,
    claimedAt: badge.claimedAt,
    status: badge.status,  // Include status
    ...(badge.status === BadgeStatus.REVOKED && {
      revokedAt: badge.revokedAt,
      revocationReason: badge.revocationReason,
      revocationNotes: badge.revocationNotes
    })
  }));

## Estimation

### Breakdown
| Task | Hours | Assignee |
|------|-------|----------|
| Backend: Update my-badges API | 0.5h | Dev |
| Frontend: Badge filter UI | 1h | Dev |
| Frontend: BadgeCard status display | 1h | Dev |
| Frontend: BadgeDetailsModal revocation section | 0.5h | Dev |
| Styling (Tailwind CSS) | 0.5h | Dev |
| Unit tests (Frontend + Backend) | 1h | Dev |
| E2E tests | 0.5h | Dev |
| Manual testing & fixes | 0.5h | Dev |
| **Total** | **5.5h** | |

### Confidence Level
Medium-High - UI work with some complexity in filtering

---

## Dependencies

### Depends On
- [x] Story 0.1: Git Branch Creation
- [x] Story 9.1: Badge Revocation API (must have revoked badges)

### Blocks
- Story U.1: Complete Lifecycle UAT (requires wallet display)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Employees upset seeing revoked badges | Low | Medium | Default to "Active" filter, empathetic messaging |
| Filter UI confusing | Low | Low | Use standard tab pattern, clear labels |
| Performance with many badges | Low | Low | Client-side filtering is fast, paginate if needed |

---

## Questions & Assumptions

### Assumptions
- Default filter is "Active" (hides revoked badges unless clicked)
- Employees can see their own revocation reasons (transparent)
- No "dispute" or "appeal" action in this story (future enhancement)
- Filter state saved in session storage (not user preferences DB)

### Open Questions
- Should we show count in filter tabs? (e.g., "Revoked (3)") → Yes, per wireframe
- Should we allow bulk hide/unhide of revoked badges? → Not in this story

**Estimated Start:** February 4, 2026 (Day 2)  
**Estimated Completion:** February 4, 2026 (Day 2)
