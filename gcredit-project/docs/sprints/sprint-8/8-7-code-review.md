# Story 8.7 Code Review

**Story/Task:** 8.7 Architecture Fixes - Token Rotation & Authorization
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Reviewer:** Amelia (Dev Agent)

---

## Scope Reviewed
- Refresh token rotation logic
- JWT secret validation at startup
- Badge template ownership checks
- Unit tests for token rotation and JWT validation

---

## Summary
Core architecture fixes are present and generally aligned with AC1/AC3, but there are a few security/consistency gaps that could cause unexpected refresh failures or weaken AC2 requirements.

---

## Findings

### 🟠 Medium

1) **Refresh token DB expiry is hard-coded to 7 days, ignoring `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN`**
- JWT expiry uses config, but DB expiry is always 7 days. If config changes (e.g., 30d), tokens can be valid in JWT but rejected by DB, or vice versa.
- Evidence: [auth.service.ts](gcredit-project/backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts#L110), [auth.service.ts](gcredit-project/backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts#L309)
- Impact: Unexpected 401s or inconsistent token lifetime enforcement.

2) **Weak `JWT_SECRET` is allowed in non-production, which conflicts with AC2**
- AC2 expects startup failure when secret is weak. Current logic only throws in production and allows weak secrets in development with a warning.
- Evidence: [main.ts](gcredit-project/backend/src/main.ts#L50-L57)
- Impact: AC2 not strictly met outside production; weak secrets can slip into non-prod environments.

### 🟡 Low

3) **JWT validation tests are not aligned with the actual startup logic**
- Tests validate a local helper rather than the real `validateJwtSecret()` implementation, and the weak-secret list differs from production (missing the `123456...` weak pattern).
- Evidence: [jwt-validation.spec.ts](gcredit-project/backend/src/config/jwt-validation.spec.ts#L36), [main.ts](gcredit-project/backend/src/main.ts#L43)
- Impact: Tests can pass while real startup behavior changes or diverges.

---

## Recommendations
- Compute refresh token `expiresAt` based on the same configuration used by JWT (`JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN`).
- Decide whether AC2 should be strict across all environments; if yes, fail startup on weak secrets even in development.
- Refactor JWT validation tests to call the real validation function, or export the helper and reuse it so tests stay aligned.

## Outcome
**Status:** Changes requested (medium findings present).
