# Sprint 12 Backlog

**Sprint Number:** Sprint 12  
**Sprint Goal:** Complete the three core management UIs (Skill, User, Milestone) and unify the evidence system, giving admins full platform control through the browser.  
**Duration:** TBD (Phase 2 review will confirm dates)  
**Team Capacity:** Solo developer + AI agents  
**Sprint Lead:** LegendZhu

---

## Sprint Goal

Deliver the remaining admin management interfaces (Skill Category, Skill, User, Milestone) and resolve the dual evidence system (TD-010), so that ALL admin operations can be performed through the UI without direct database access. Secondary: clean up activity feed formatting (TD-016) and skill UUID display (TD-017).

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Admin can CRUD Skill Categories (hierarchical, 3-level tree)
- [ ] Admin can CRUD Skills within categories
- [ ] Admin can manage users (role edit, lock/unlock, search)
- [ ] Admin can manage Milestones (CRUD, activate/deactivate)
- [ ] Evidence system unified — single EvidenceFile model, no more Dual paths
- [ ] All existing tests pass + new tests for Sprint 12 features
- [ ] Activity feed shows readable descriptions (not JSON)

## Wave Structure (per Lesson 41)

### Wave 1: Admin Management UIs (Stories 12.1 — 12.4)
*Focus: New admin pages for Skill, User, Milestone management*

| # | Story | Priority | Est | Depends On |
|---|-------|----------|-----|------------|
| 12.1 | Skill Category Management UI | 🔴 HIGH | 10h | — |
| 12.2 | Skill Management UI | 🔴 HIGH | 10h | 12.1 |
| 12.3 | User Management UI Enhancement | 🔴 HIGH | 10h | — |
| 12.4 | Milestone Admin UI | 🟡 MEDIUM | 8h | — |

**Parallelization:** 12.1 → 12.2 (sequential). 12.3, 12.4 independent — can run parallel with 12.1/12.2.

### Wave 2: Evidence Unification (Stories 12.5 — 12.6)
*Focus: Resolve TD-010 — backend data model + frontend UI*

| # | Story | Priority | Est | Depends On |
|---|-------|----------|-----|------------|
| 12.5 | Evidence Unification — Data Model | 🔴 HIGH | 14h | — |
| 12.6 | Evidence Unification — UI | 🔴 HIGH | 10h | 12.5 |

**Parallelization:** 12.5 → 12.6 (sequential). Can run after Wave 1 or in parallel if not resource-constrained.

### Wave 3: Quick Fixes (Stories 12.7 — 12.8)
*Focus: Small tech debt items — can be done anytime*

| # | Story | Priority | Est | Depends On |
|---|-------|----------|-----|------------|
| 12.7 | Admin Activity Feed Formatting | 🟢 LOW | 3h | — |
| 12.8 | Skills UUID Fallback Hardening | 🟢 LOW | 2h | — |

**Parallelization:** Both independent — can be done anytime as buffer work.

### Wave 4: UAT (Story 12.9)
*Focus: User acceptance testing of all Sprint 12 features*

| # | Story | Priority | Est | Depends On |
|---|-------|----------|-----|------------|
| 12.9 | Sprint 12 UAT | 🟡 MEDIUM | 5h | 12.1–12.8 all complete |

**Timing:** Execute after all development stories are done, before merge to main.

## Sprint Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Evidence migration corrupts data | Medium | High | Reversible migration + backup, test on copy first |
| Skill tree performance (deep nesting) | Low | Medium | Limit to 3 levels (schema enforced) |
| API contract changes break frontend | Medium | Medium | Version API, update consumers in same PR |
| Scope creep from Phase 2 review | Medium | Low | Architect/UX can suggest but SM gates scope |

---

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- 12.2 depends on 12.1 (Skill UI needs Category tree component)
- 12.6 depends on 12.5 (Evidence UI needs unified API)

### External Dependencies
- None — no new Azure resources, no SSO changes

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Target coverage: >80%
- New test files for each story
- Key: migration script tests, tree CRUD tests, evidence type tests

### E2E Impact
- Existing E2E scripts should not break (no auth changes)
- New pages: manual walkthrough + optional Playwright updates

---

## Notes

### Phase 2 Review Items
All 8 stories are marked "⚠️ Phase 2 Review Needed". Party Mode session with Architect (Winston) + UX Designer (Sally) will:
- Review tech approach for Evidence Unification (12.5/12.6)
- Review UI layouts/interactions for new admin pages (12.1-12.4)
- Validate estimates
- Confirm/adjust wave ordering

### Phase 2 Review Findings (Applied)
All 8 stories reviewed by Architect (Winston) + UX Designer (Sally) on 2026-02-19.

**Key decisions:**
- Drag-and-drop for tree reorder (`@dnd-kit`, same-level only)
- Skill tag colors derived from category (`color` field on SkillCategory)
- Inline add skill (tab-to-submit)
- Shared components: `<AdminPageShell>`, `<ConfirmDialog>`, `<CategoryTree>`, `<EvidenceList>`
- Milestone trigger Zod schemas per type
- Evidence field renamed: `sourceUrl` (not `externalUrl`)
- Two-phase migration (schema + data script separately)
- Bulk issuance impact: +2h to Story 12.5
- Two-step issuance UX (issue → attach evidence)
- `Badge.evidenceUrl` kept through Sprint 12 for backward compat, removed Sprint 13

**Estimate change:** 61h → 65h (+2h Story 12.1 for dnd + shared components, +2h Story 12.5 for bulk issuance) → 70h (+5h Story 12.9 UAT added) → **72h** (+2h Story 12.2 for category color propagation)

### Items Deferred to Sprint 13

| # | Item | Source | Est. | Reason |
|---|------|--------|------|--------|
| D-1 | Responsive tree→dropdown (`<1024px`) | Story 12.1 Task 1 | ~2h | Admin 管理页面主要桌面端使用，非核心 AC |
| D-2 | Blue insertion line (DnD visual feedback) | Story 12.1 Task 2 | ~1h | 需要 DragOverlay 自定义，当前 opacity 反馈可用 |
| D-3 | Cross-level "Move to..." action | Story 12.1 Task 2 | ~3h | 需新增后端 reparent API + MoveToDialog，独立功能点 |
| D-4 | Remove deprecated `Badge.evidenceUrl` field | Story 12.5 | ~1h | Sprint 12 保留向后兼容，Sprint 13 移除 |

**Total Sprint 13 carry-forward: ~7h**

### Lessons Applied from Sprint 11
- **Lesson 41:** Wave structure for parallelization
- **Lesson 42:** Stories are implementation-ready with explicit ACs and task lists
- **Lesson 43:** E2E test awareness — grep for affected consumers before committing
