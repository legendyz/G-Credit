## 📚 Documentation Structure

The new documentation structure follows a clear organizational pattern:

```
gcredit-project/
├── docs/                           # Project-level documentation
│   ├── architecture/              # System architecture
│   │   ├── system-architecture.md # Main architecture doc (5,406 lines)
│   │   └── README.md              # Architecture index
│   ├── planning/                  # Planning artifacts
│   │   ├── epics.md               # 14 epics, 85 stories
│   │   ├── ux-design-specification.md
│   │   ├── ux-design-directions.html
│   │   ├── implementation-readiness-report-2026-01-22.md
│   │   └── README.md              # Planning index
│   ├── sprints/                   # Sprint documentation
│   ├── decisions/                 # Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── lessons-learned/           # Project knowledge base
│   └── INDEX.md                   # Documentation master index
└── project-context.md             # Single Source of Truth
```

## ℹ️ Why Was This Changed?

The documentation reorganization was completed to:

1. **Improve Discoverability** - Logical grouping makes documents easy to find
2. **Establish Clear Ownership** - Separate project-level, architecture, and planning docs
3. **Support Scalability** - Structure supports multiple applications
4. **Separate Concerns** - Architecture separate from planning, separate from implementation
5. **Simplify Onboarding** - New team members can navigate easily

For complete details, see the [Documentation Reorganization Report](../../gcredit-project/docs/DOCUMENTATION-REORGANIZATION-COMPLETE.md).
